Abstract: Real-Time Object Detection System for Placement Application
In today's dynamic environments, object detection plays a crucial role in multiple domains such as security, automation, and event management. This project showcases a Real-Time Object Detection and Classification System, designed to detect and classify objects with high accuracy and speed, utilizing cutting-edge deep learning technologies.

The system is built around the YOLOv8 model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its efficiency. It processes live video feeds or pre-recorded videos to detect objects and classify them into predefined categories. Key features include:

Live Object Detection: Real-time processing of video feeds for detecting and tracking objects.
Object Classification: Accurate classification of objects into 80 categories from the COCO dataset.
Interactive Visualization: Display of bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores using enhanced UI elements.
Scalability: Adaptable to various hardware environments, from high-performance GPUs to standard CPUs.
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python, OpenCV, and deep learning frameworks. It reflects the ability to build real-world AI-driven applications with potential use cases in security systems, traffic management, and surveillance. With its innovative approach and practical application, this project positions itself as a strong portfolio addition for placement opportunities in AI and machine learning roles.
